## A fancier application is for a macro impl can use its ARG as a nested tmpl
## with another renderer to do: `${(SELECT)x,y FROM Points *** <tr> <td>$1</td>
## <td>$2</td> </tr>}` [ the idea being SELECT splits on "***" then loops over
## query output rendering a post-*** tmpl to fill an HTML table].  That this can
## work is no accident.  Call syntax was designed to minimize lexical commitments
## to mingle well with surrounding syntax & to let macros define any sub-syntax
## in ARG.  Semantics/interpretation/render was also intentionally deferred.
