# cligen: A Native API-Inferred Command-Line Interface Generator For Nim

This approach to CLIs was inspired by Andrey Mikhaylenko's Python
[argh](https://pythonhosted.org/argh/)
([Click](https://github.com/pallets/click/) became more popular).
The key observation is that proc signatures already encode what you need to
generate CLIs - names, types, and default values.  Reflection then suffices to
generate parser-dispatchers translating `seq[string]` command input into calls
to a wrapped proc.  In Nim, adding a CLI can be 1-line of code:
```nim
proc fun(foo=1,bar=2.0,baz="x",verb=false,args: seq[string]): int=
  ## An API call doc comment
  result = 1      # Of course, real code would have real work here
import cligen; dispatch fun # Whoa..Just 1 line??
```
Compile it to `fun` (e.g., `nim c fun.nim`) and then run `./fun --help`
to get a minimal (but not so useless!) help message:
```
Usage:
  fun [optional-params] [args: string...]
An API call doc comment
Options:
  -h, --help                    print this cligen-erated help
  --help-syntax                 advanced: prepend,plurals,..
  -f=, --foo=    int     1      set foo
  -b=, --bar=    float   2.0    set bar
  --baz=         string  "x"    set baz
  -v, --verb     bool    false  set verb
```
That's it!  No specification language/complex arg parsing API/Nim pragma tags
to learn.  Installing can be as simple as `nimble install cligen` or even just
`git clone <thisRepo>` and `nim c --path:whereYouClonedTo myProgram.nim`.  If
you aren't sold already, here is more
[MOTIVATION](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/tree/master/MOTIVATION.md).

The `help` column is filled with generic `set foo` placeholders by default.
You can override that using parameter-keyed association-list literals:
```nim
dispatch fun, help={"foo": "the beginning", "bar": "the rate"}
```
The same goes for `short` versions of the CLI arguments.  More on that
[below](#common-overrides-program-exit-config-fileenvironment-vars).

Other invocations (`./fun --foo 2 -b=2.7 --baz:"ho"...`) work as expected.

Default help tables work with automated "help to X" tools such as `complete -F
_longopt` in bash, `compdef _gnu_generic` in Zsh, or the GNU `help2man` (e.g.
`help2man -N ./fun|man /dev/stdin`).

Nim CLI authors who have read this far can mostly use `cligen` already.  Enter
`--help`, `--help-syntax`/`--helps`, or illegal commands to get help messages,
syntax, exhibit mappings, etc.  Out of the box, `cligen` supports conversion for
most basic Nim types (`int`s, `float`s, `enum`s, `seq`s, `set`s, `HashSet`s of
them, ranges, etc.) [but can be extended](#custom-parameter-types-or-parsing).

### CLusage: Param Match/Help Render, Trailing & Required Args

`cligen`-erated parsers accept **any unambiguous prefix** for long options.
In other words, long options can be as short as possible.  In yet other words,
hitting the TAB key to complete is unnecessary **if** the completion is unique.
This is patterned after, e.g. gnuplot, gdb, Vim ex-commands, etc.  Long options
can also be **spelled flexibly**, e.g. `--dry-run`|`--dryRun`, like Nim's
style-insensitive identifiers, but with extra "kebab-case-insensitivity".
The exact spelling of the key in `help` controls the look of printed help.

Layout details like column spacing and help colorization are controlled [by a
CL user config file](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/tree/master/configs).
Here are screenshots of example
[night](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-blake/cligen/master/screenshots/dirqHelpNight.png)
and
[day](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-blake/cligen/master/screenshots/dupsHelpDay.png)
themes.)

---

Most commands have some trailing variable length sequence of arguments like
`args` in the first example.  `cligen` automatically treats the first
non-defaulted `seq[T]` proc parameter as such an optional sequence.  `cligen`
applies the same basic string-to-native type converters/parsers used for option
values to such parameters.

---

If a proc parameter has no **explicit** default value (via `=`) then it becomes
required.  The input syntax is the same as for optional values.  So, in
```nim
proc fun(myRequired: float, mynums: seq[int], foo=1) = discard
when isMainModule: # Preserve ability to `import api`/call from Nim
  import cligen; dispatch fun
```
the command-line user must give `--myRequired=something` somewhere.  Non-option
arguments must be parsable as `int` with whitespace stripped, e.g. `./fun
--myRequired=2.0 1 2 " -3" -- -4`.

More general user semantics for argument validation (required-ness, length,
"sub-parsing", etc.) can be done like
[UserError.nim](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/blob/master/test/UserError.nim).

### Custom Parameter Types, Parsing, Or Default Renders

While `cligen/argcvt` supports basic Nim types, the parsing/printing system is
*extensible* via in-`dispatch` scope `argParse` & `argHelp` overloads for types.
A simple example:
```nim
import std/times
proc foo(i = 42, d = now()): void = echo d

when isMainModule:
  import cligen/argcvt, cligen
  proc argParse(dst: var DateTime, dfl: DateTime,
                a: var ArgcvtParams): bool =
    try: dst = times.parse(a.val, "yyyyMMdd")
    except TimeParseError:
      echo "bad DateTime: ", a.val; return false
    return true

  proc argHelp(dfl: DateTime, a: var ArgcvtParams): seq[string]=
    @[a.argKeys, "DateTime", getDateStr(dfl)]

  dispatch foo, help={"i": "favorite number", "d": "birthday"}
```
These two "argument IO" procs take a shared coordination parameter for argument
metadata (more fully documented in `cligen/argcvt.nim`).  As just a simple e.g.,
`a.parNm` is the name of the parameter being parsed.  While not usually useful,
this can be used to parse the same Nim type differently (based on the name),
detect when CLusers alter parameters from defaults, count uses, etc.

This same mechanism can ***override existing*** `cligen/argcvt` parser/helpers
if the built-ins are not what you want.  Consulting `cligen/argcvt` for examples
is a good idea.  E.g., [test/FancyRepeats.nim](test/FancyRepeats.nim) shows how
to change `argParse` and/or `argHelp` for `int`.  *All* conversions can be
overridden to taste this way (or even the whole `cligen/argcvt.nim` module).

### Subcommands, dispatch to object init

`dispatchMulti` lets you expose two or more procs with subcommands a la `git` or
`nimble`. Each `[]` list in `dispatchMulti` is the argument list for each
sub-`dispatch`.  Tune command syntax and help strings in the same way as
`dispatch` as in:
```nim
proc foo(myRequired: int, mynums: seq[int], foo=1) = discard
  ## Some API call
proc bar(yippee: int, myFlts: seq[float], verb=false) = discard
  ## Some other API call
when isMainModule:
  import cligen
  dispatchMulti([foo, help={"myRequired": "Need it!"}], [bar])
```
With the above in `cmd.nim`, CLI users can run `./cmd foo -m1` or
`./cmd bar -y10 1.0 2.0`.  `./cmd` or `./cmd --help` print brief help messages
while `./cmd help` prints a comprehensive message, and `./cmd SUBCMD --help`
or `./cmd help SUBCMD` print a message for just `SUBCMD` (e.g. `foo`|`bar`).

Like long option keys or `enum` value names, subcommand names can also be ***any
unambiguous prefix and are case-kebab-insensitive***.  So, `./cmd f-O -m1` would
also work above.

---

Rather than dispatching to a proc and exiting, you can also initialize the
***fields of an object/tuple*** from the command-line with `initFromCL` which
has the same keyword parameters as the most salient features of `dispatch`:
```nim
type App* = object
  srcFile*: string
  show*: bool
const dfl* = App(srcFile: "junk") # set defaults!=default for type

proc logic*(a: var App) = echo "app is: ", a

when isMainModule:
  import cligen
  var app = initFromCL(dfl, help = { "srcFile": "yadda yadda" })
  app.logic # Only --help/--version/parse errors cause early exit
```

### Common Overrides, Program Exit, Config File/Environment Vars

You can manually control the short option for any parameter via `short`:
```nim
dispatch fun, short={"bar" : 'r'}
```
If you'd like to define `short` or `help` parameters outside of a `dispatch`
call, you need an explicit conversion to a `Table` symbol:
```nim
import cligen; clCfg.longPfxOk = false  # {.define(cgCfgNone).}..
from std/tables import toTable          #..blocks syntax config
const
  Help  = { "foo": "the beginning", "bar": "the rate" }.toTable()
  Short = { "foo": 'f', "bar": 'r'}.toTable()
proc fun(foo = 1, bar = 2, baz = "hi") = discard
dispatch(fun, help = Help, short = Short)
```
With that `"bar"` gets `'r'` while `"baz"` gets `'b'` as short options.  To
suppress a long option getting *any* short option, specify a short key `'\0'`.
To suppress _all_ short options, give `short` a key of `""`.  Making `longPfxOk`
false instead of the default `true` means CLusers must say `--foo`, not `--fo`.

To suppress API parameters in the CLI, pass `suppress = @["apiParam", ...]`.
(For object init, "ALL AFTER field" stops fieldPairs iteration.)  To suppress
presence only in help messages use `help={"apiParam": "CLIGEN-NOHELP"}`.  Pass
`implicitDefault = @["apiParam",...]` to let the CLI wrapper default API
parameter values with no explicit initialization to the Nim default for a type.

---

The default exit protocol is (with boolean short-circuiting) `quit(int(result))
or (echo $result or discard; quit(0))`.  If `echoResult==true`, it's just
`echo $result; quit(0)`, while if `noAutoEcho==true` it's `quit(int(result)) or
(discard; quit(0))`.  The `or`s above are based on whether the wrapped proc has
a return type or `$` defined on the type.  So,
```nim
import editdistance, cligen # gen CLI for a Nim stdlib API
dispatch(editDistanceASCII, echoResult=true)
```
makes a program to print edit distance between two required parameters while
without `echoResult` it would be in the shell `$?` variable.

If these exit protocols are inadequate then you may need to call `dispatchGen()`
and later call `try: dispatchFoo(someSeqString) except: discard` yourself.
This is all `dispatch` itself does.  ***Return*** _types and values_ of the
generated dispatcher match the wrapped proc. { Other parameters to generated
dispatchers are for internal use in `dispatchMulti` and probably don't matter to
you. }  A dispatcher raises 3 exception types: `HelpOnly`, `VersionOnly`,
`ParseError`.  These are hopefully self-explanatory.

---

If you want `cligen` to merge parameters from other sources, like a per-program
config file and/or `$CMD` environment variable, then you can redefine
`mergeParams()` after `import cligen` but before `dispatch`/`dispatchMulti`:
```nim
import cligen, os, strutils # multi foo/multi bar are like subcommand example
proc mergeParams(cmdNames: seq[string], cmdLine =
                 commandLineParams()): seq[string] =
  let e = cmdNames.join("_").toUpperAscii.getEnv # $MULTI_(FOO|BAR)
  if e.len>0: e.parseCmdLine & cmdLine else: cmdLine # os.parseCmdLine
dispatchMulti([foo, short={"verb": 'v'}], [bar])
```
You can `include cligen/mergeCfgEnv` between `import cligen` & `dispatch` to
merge `${CMD_CONFIG:-${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}}/CMD` (with Nim stdlib's
`parsecfg` module) and then `$CMD` with `parseCmdLine` as above.

Unless `cgCfgNone` is defined, `cligen` programs look for
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/cligen`, e.g.
[~/.config/cligen/config](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/wiki/Example-Config-File)
which allows command-line end users to tweak colors, layout, syntax, and usage
help templates and generally set things that command authors can also [alter
defaults for](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen#common-overrides-program-exit-config-fileenvironment-vars)
in the global [`cligen.clCfg`](cligen.nim#L28C1-L56C1).

### Restrictions

 1. Can only wrap basic funcs/procs -- no `auto|var` types, generics, etc.
   
 2. Param types used must have argParse, argHelp in scope (including generic
    parameters like the `T` in `seq[T]`).

 3. No param of a wrapped proc can be named "help".  (Name collision!)

## Even More Controls and Details

`cligen` grew many features upon request & usage and discussed many others in
[closed issues](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/issues?q=is%3Aissue).  The
[test suite](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/tree/master/test/) has
suggestively named examples.  There's also [a
Wiki](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/wiki), [generated docs for various
modules](https://c-blake.github.io/cligen/) (which include various system
interfaces useful in writing CLIs) and a [set of fully worked
utilities](https://github.com/c-blake/bu) which may be useful to you in their
own right.  I also try to mention breaking changes & new features in
[RELEASE-NOTES](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen/tree/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md).
